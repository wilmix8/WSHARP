Wsharp was designed to be easy to use and is therefore easy to write,\r\ncompile, debug, and learn than other programming languages.\r\nWsharp is object-oriented. This allows you to create modular programs and reusable code.\r\nWsharp is platform-independent.\r\nx) Wsharp creates  .exe  or  .dll   files   and  it  can be  used  with   Wsharp  main  program   (CWE  EDitor  )   to  create  a  complete  software.\r\ny) Wsharp will compile and run at same time where other technology can't\r\ndo\r\nz) Wsharp is mainly used in complex programming , Billing the\r\ngoods,Graphics,etc\r\nAA) Wsharp is platform independant language\r\nBB) Wsharp is an interactive Technology.\r\nCC)  WSHARP  is   used  like  C#  in   contructing  GUI  eg)  C#  Bank  form application,etc.\r\n\r\nDD)  WSHARP  is  used  as   Encapsulating  business  logic, database  connection,Important  part  of  program\r\n\r\nand can  be  used  with JAS,JDollar,cweb  with mobile  and wallet  cloud computing.\r\n\r\nEE)  WSHARP  also  behaves like   Core  JAVA.  but it's   class  file  is  different  from  java.\r\n\r\nFF)  WSHARP  also  behaves  like CDollar.\r\n",
