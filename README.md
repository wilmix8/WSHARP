# WSHARP
=========
WSHARP  (W#) Programming  language is  used   for software  development  and  Remote Webapplication it  is   invented   by   wilmix jemin  j  at JDollar and  C# at year   2016  and   it  is better than CDollar.


SYNTAX:
=======




<WSHARP>
<USE> WDBA;
<USE> CDollar.WDBA;
<IMPORT> 
<PACK> MyP
{
    <CLASS> Programs
    {
          public void main()
        {
		
<! Wsharp logic!>

		
}


}

}




Advantages:
===========


Wsharp ADvantages over JAVA and other Programming Languages
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A) Wsharp is the combination of JAVA , C/C++, and Advanced OOPS.
b) Wsharp will only accept the shortest attractive syntax.
c) Wsharp also used for construction of any datastructures.
d)  WSHarp  is  easy  to  learn  focus  and  use  and  userfriendly.
e) Wsharp Solves diamond Problem with multiple Inheritance .
f) It also supports friendly function, pointers , and structures.
g) Wsharp support Virtual memmory and garbage collection.
h) It is efficient, fast and easy to understand, and it is a OOPS Technology.
i) Wsharp is a High level language.
j) Wsharp is highly portable language
k) Using Wsharp you can create any datastructures as libraries and
use it in your Application program.
l) Wsharp language is a structured and object programming language.
m) Wsharp has OOPS concepts like JAVA.
n) Wsharp have the concept of Packages,etc.
o) Wsharp have the concept of constructor or destructor and had magic oops concepts.
p) It Support functions with Default Arguments
q) It Supports Exception handling
r) It Support Generic Programming
s) It have pointer and Nodes..
t) Wsharp is much simpler oops concepts, which leads to faster development and less mental
overhead.
u) Wsharp is almost always explicitly compiled
w) Wsharp is easy to learn. Wsharp was designed to be easy to use and is therefore easy to write,
compile, debug, and learn than other programming languages.
Wsharp is object-oriented. This allows you to create modular programs and reusable code.
Wsharp is platform-independent.
x) Wsharp creates  .exe  or  .dll   files   and  it  can be  used  with   Wsharp  main  program   (CWE  EDitor  )   to  create  a  complete  software.
y) Wsharp will compile and run at same time where other P.L can't
do
z) Wsharp is mainly used in complex programming , Billing the
goods,Graphics,etc
AA) Wsharp is platform independant language
BB) Wsharp is an interactive P.L.
CC)  WSHARP  is   used  like  C#  in   contructing  GUI  eg)  C#  Bank  form application,etc.

DD)  WSHARP  is  used  as   Encapsulating  business  logic, database  connection,Important  part  of  program

and can  be  used  with JAS,JDollar,cweb  with mobile  and wallet  Remotewebapplication.

EE)  WSHARP  also  behaves like   Core  JAVA.  but it's   class  file  is  different  from  java.

FF)  WSHARP  also  behaves  like CDollar.
